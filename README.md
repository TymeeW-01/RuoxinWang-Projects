## UCSB Capstone Program: Identifying Anomalous Transactions Sponsored by Appfolio, Inc.
**Project Website**: https://pstat197.github.io/projects/projects-22-23.html#appfolio

This project sponsored by Appfolio, Inc. primarily worked on anomalous transaction  detection. The goal for this project is to develop an explainable method for  outlier detection by comparing and evaluating various algorithms that can be further  used in Appfolio property management work. By implementing multiple methodologies like data normalization, adding self-created features, and comparing different  algorithms like isolation forest and local outlier factors, we are able to come up with a  final isolation forest model that identified anomalous transactions with a precision of 75%. I primarily researched and worked on the modeling section of the project, including both local outlier factors algorithm and isolation forest algorithm, and took the responsibility of meeting organizer for the team. 
## PSTAT 100: Exploring Data Analysis on Countries' Sustainability with ESG Data
This project mainly investigates the sustainability of countries worldwide through Environment, Social, and Governance aspects and analyze the variation among the principal components of each country. The motive is to find out which country is most sustainable during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. According to the Principal Components Analysis, there are no significant changes in the chosen ESG variables during the pandemic. Although the variation of GDP growth is thought to be an influential component, it doesn't affect the result a lot. Hence, a new sustainability score evaluation method is used and Vietnam is considered the most sustainable country in 2019 and 2020.
## PSTAT 174: Time Series Analysis on US Candy Production Data
The purpose of this project was to apply time series analysis techniques from PSTAT 174 to analyze a real- world time series data set “US Candy Production, 1982 - 1999” and predict future data points via forecasting. My questions addressed in this project is whether the candy production in the US has seasonality and how it going to develop in the following years. To analyze this time series data set, I first plot out the raw data and utilize box-cox transformation to stable the variance and differenced data to make it stationary. Then, plotting out the sample ACF and PACF graph allows me to choose candidate models needed to be further fitted, which are SARIMA(1, 1, 1)(0, 1, 1)[12], SARIMA(0, 1, 2)(0, 1, 1)[12], SARIMA(2, 1, 2)(0, 1, 1)[12]. Selecting the best model according to the AICc scores and use diagnostic checking with p-value of three additional tests greater than 0.05 to confirm that the model residual ACF, PACF, normaltiy, independence, fitting AR(0) work well to behave like a white noise. Finally, I forecast and make prediction with a 95% confidence interval for the following years. According to the forecasting result, all the prediction points are inside the 95% confidence interval and show a seasonal pattern with a increasing trend, which can make a further conclusion that US candy production was affected by a seasonal factor and the amount of production would increase in the following years.
## PSTAT 131: Statistical Machine Learning Analysis on 2020 US Election Data
Predicting voter behavior is complicated for many reasons despite the tremendous effort in collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and understanding many available datasets. Although the 2016 presidential election came as a big surprise to many, Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election has been widely predicted. As a result, the goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the 2020 presidential election dataset to further predict the election winner with statistical machine learning models. In addition to the visualization of the election dataset, I also combined the Untied States county-level census data with the election data to do a further exploration on any potential relationships between these two dataset. And finally, I built and selected classification models to predict the election winner.
